### Hello!

I am the co-founder and principal maintainer of [Apiman](https://www.github.com/apiman/apiman), an open source API Management platform.

I founded the company [Black Parrot Labs](https://www.blackparrotlabs.io) to provide top-notch support for enterprise users of Apiman. A key goal of BPL is to sustain and support the upstream project.

If you want anything Apiman-related, we can do it! Ask me about Apiman via marc@blackparrotlabs.io 💬, or you can [schedule a meeting directly via cal.com](https://cal.com/marcsavy) 🗣️.

* 💼 Consulting and support
* 👷 Custom Apiman policies (i.e. make Apiman do something custom to traffic passing through the gateway)
* ⚙️ Custom component implementations and strategies (e.g. custom rate limiting implementation on your datastore of choice)
* 🔎 Troubleshooting
* 🌱 Creating or sponsoring new features
* 💾 Adding support for your favourite database
* 🐛 Bugfixes
* 🚀 Scalability and optimisation 
* 💡 ... you name it!

And, of course, it allows us to continue developing Apiman and pushing things forwards.
